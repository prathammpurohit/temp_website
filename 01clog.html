  <h1><strong>FIRST DAY AND I AM GIVING UP</strong></h1><br><br><br>
  <p>you know i have a masterpiece in my head, i had been dreaming of it since past 3 years, though i can never make it(atleast it seems like that).<br><br>
    it's not the first time i am giving up on something, last month i started typing in dvoark, and i can type constantly 80-95 wpm in querty(my best is 109 in 30 secs).... and i was doing pretty decent within 2 and half weeks i reached 50 wpm, and i quitted, i mean idk why, my head gets invested in my head and i break the routine.<br><br>
    <strong>I CAN BE THE ASIATIC MARK ZUCKERBERG AND I AM NOT KIDDING!!!</strong> you will see one day, and i mean it!, but rn i need a job i am afraid of failing as a son.<br><br>
    i behave normal and i am normal when i am around people, but trust me i am fucked up, for past 5 years life had been hard but anyhow recently i adjusted to the uncertainity of life and started appreciating and accepting the beauty around me, come on everything has beauty.
    <br><br>idk where am i going, where would world take me, lets see what story i am carrying in this play of odds.<br><br>
    I think i am pretty good understanding c-family languages, but my masterpiece is for masses(it's hard for me to pivot to web dev, though i have been learning it since past 2 years but it's not a piece of cake to me(atleast it seems so)).<br><br>
    <strong>HOPEFULLY I FIGURE IT OUT AND COMPLETE MY MASTERPIECE, ADIOS</strong>
