  <h1><strong>DAMN THIS OVERTHINKING!!</strong></h1>
  <br><br><br>
  <p>I am low, and sadly i am not in the state to explain my condition. I was a brilliant kid when I entered the unviersity, everyone admired me from students to my faculty. I have become a commoner like others. I never feared of not getiing a job, but now i am afraid. I need an internship immediately in this sem break and i still couldnt figure out what my interests are.<br><br>
  I want to do the low level stuffs and i dont know much about the things like system programming, network programming, bash scripting ( these stuff fascinates me and idk will i be able to excel them, i am a failed frontend dev my mind starts drowning when i am watching frontend tutorials)... but i need a job, no ones gonna give me a c developer job at this stage or will someone, shall i try AI? or shall i go wtih blockchain? Hahhhhhhhh..... does it even matter i even don't know backend development yet
  <br><br>man i am fucked up( and i am the absolute culprit of it)
  <br><br>btw i miss my girlfriend, i aint a good boyfriend, shes epitomy of purity and i feel bad hurting her</p>
