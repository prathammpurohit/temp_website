  <h1><strong>I MET MRS SONIA TODAY, AND SHE'S THE REAL G</strong></h1>
  <br><br><br>
  <p>I was going through a character development and I interacted with her for the first time in ever since I'm in this university. She seems so normal, she didn't look like a chad developer, but man she's the chad developer I was looking for.
  <br><br>
  So I was going through a lot, a lot was happening in my head. I can't write a shitty codebase in javascript or python for my masterpiece. Rust and C are the language I'm thinking to go with, but these are the languages. I want to use them to build my own complier, operating system, do a little bit of network programming, building CLI before diving into my masterpiece.
  <br><br>
  I was passing through the beautiful mountain facing corridor and I saw her taking sun. I passed by and I came back, sat besides her, and just started sharing my dilemma.... and and and she got my points!!! No one ever in last 2 years have ever got me, but she did.

<strong> I feel better today</strong>
