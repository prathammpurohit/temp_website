  <h1><strong>I MET MRS SONIA TODAY AND SHE'S THE REAL G</strong></h1><br><br><br>
  <p>"i am going through a character development, i am not yet at that level... damn i so badly want to be that OG guy. do i even know C the way i want to know? i am failed frontend dev. my ranking in competitve coding is nowhere to even tier 3 coders. ahhhhhhhhh....." i was thinking and
  i passed by a secnic mountain pass( my univeristy is in himalayas) and that didn't made me feel any better (acutally never since after first sem). <br><br>
  i met mrs sonia. she's so simple. she doesn't look like a developer, chad dev is far talk. this was the first time i interacted with her ever since i'm here in this university<br><br>
  I sat besides her and just started talking, i didnt care if shes a faculty or elder, i just started sharing  my problems. i know nothing about compiler design, system programming, network programming, i know nothing... i can't risk myself by writing a shitty javascript or python code for masterpiece
  <br><br>
  i didn't seek her help, i just wanted someone to listen my tech hell.... and and and she understood what i was up to.... damn first time in last 3 years someone got what i was trying to say, before that i only heard these kind of conversation on youtube channle of primeagen and tsoding. i never acutally talked this way to someone.
  <br><br>
  <strong>I feel better today.</strong></p>
